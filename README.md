# Sunrise alarm-clock

I created this simple project to help me wake up during dark winters in a natural way - using light. It's harder to fall asleep again when there is light in the room ;) This repository contains the code and description of the ESP32 circuit and the code for the web server that I use to set the time of the alarm. I personally deployed the server to Raspberry Pi Zero. Both of the devices are connected to the local network and hence are usable from any device that is connected to our local network.

### Content of the repository

- esp: Code for the ESP32 and the description of the whole circuit and how it works internally.
- server: Code for the web server and front-end for setting the alarm.

See README in the respective sub-directories for more details.
